I have forked an existing repo and refactored it to add Allure HTML report.

Below modificaiton done.

1. Updated latest chromedriver matching with my chrome version
2. Added Allure command line tool to package.json
3. Added 'report' under scripts in package.json to generate the report.

    Pre-requiste:
    
      Java version > 8 should be installed.
      
      Install Allure (in MAC) => brew install allure
      
      Install allure command line => npm install allure-commandline


### Run test
=> npm install

=> ENV=qa npm test

After test execution - 'allure-results' folder would be created in the project root.

### Generate Allure HTML report
=> allure generate ./allure-results --clean

After the command executed successfully, 'allure-report' folder would be created in the project root.

### Navigate to allure-report folder. Open html report

=> allure open ./allure-report

### Or, Generaet and open HTML Report using script command 'Report'
In the root folder, execute below command, it will generate html report and start the server and open index.html in a browser.

=> npm run report
